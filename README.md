# Train A Constructive Feedback Detecting Model for Amazon Product Reviews
Applied Natural Language Processing to identify constructive criticism

### Abstract:
Identifying constructive feedback in customer reviews is critical for improving products, services, and packaging in digital marketplaces like Amazon and millions of sellers. This research develops a model to detect actionable suggestions or criticisms in prodcut reviews, distinguishing specific, improvement-oriented feedback (e.g., “These were lightweight and soft but much too small for my liking. I would have preferred two of these together to make one loc.”) from vague statements like “I don’t like it.” By leveraging natural language processing into Machine Learning, this study provides insights into optimizing feedback detection to enhance seller responsiveness and customer satisfaction.

### What the project revealed?
1.	**BERT-based models** demonstrate potential for filtering constructive criticism more effectively, compared to based-line models of logistic regression and random forest.
2.	Stratigies of removing positive sentences, failed to significantly enhance performance.
3.	Utilizing a pre-trained dataset of 12,000 news comments also did not yield notable performance improvements.
